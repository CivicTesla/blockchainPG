# Simple Math Smart Contract
## How to setup the contract
Follow the steps, denoted in the README in folder "Scripts"

## Brief Content of this smart contract
### Purpose
You can pass an input to the contract. The included functions then can compute the result which is 'result = input^2+1'

### Functions
setResult: Does the computation itself. No Output.
getResult: Writes the result to the public variable which then can be accessed by everyone. No direct Output to the console.
outputResult: Shows the result of the computation in the console BUT no writing to the public variable -> result cannot be accessed by other nodes.
